üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You will need a modern web browser and a code editor. You will also need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/thatcoolcoder1/movie-finder.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd movie-finder


Install dependencies:
